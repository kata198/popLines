- pydoc
- Support negative "numLines" to popHead, which will pop from the start up to
the -Nth line. For example, popHead -3 on a file with 8 lines will pop the
first 5 lines.
- Support negative "numLines" to popTail, which will pop from the end up to
the Nth line. For example, popTail -3 on a file with 8 lines will pop the last
5 lines.

* 2.0.0 - Feb 28 2017
- Add the "--peek" option to all of the pop* commands and the module (as "saveChanges" argument, default True). 
  This can be used to just pull the lines without modifying the source file (i.e. instead of a queue, you can use it for simple extraction)
- Add the "--ordered" option (and keepOrdered in module) to the "popRandom" command. When this is present, the output lines will still be picked at random, but they will be output in the order they appear in the file. By default, the old behaviour is retained, and random lines will be output in random order.

* 1.1.1 - Feb 28 2017
- Add missing scripts to setup.py

* 1.1.0 - Jan 13 2016
- Cleaned up and expanded on documentation
- Added two new modes and commands, "range" for doing a range (start,stop or
start,stop,step) and "these" for specific lines. All are one-origin
inclusive.

* 1.0.0 - Jan 13 2016
- First Release
